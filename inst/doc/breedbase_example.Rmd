## QBMS
Linking data management systems to analytics is an important step in breeding digitalization. Breeders can use this R package to Query the [Breeding Management System](https://bmspro.io/) database (using [BrAPI](https://brapi.org/) calls) and help them to retrieve their experiments data directly into R statistical analyzing environment.

Well, because **Breedbase** supports the **BrAPI** standard, most of the QBMS functionalities work smoothly with minor changes. For example, you need to give special attention to the `set_qbms_config` parameters (check the example below). Currently, some functions are not supported when working with BreedBase, like `get_program_studies`, `get_germplasm_data`, and `list_trials` filtered by year!

## BreedBase
[Breedbase](https://breedbase.org/) is a comprehensive breeding management and analysis software. It can be used to design field layouts, collect phenotypic information using tablets, support the collection of genotyping samples in a field, store large amounts of high density genotypic information, and provide Genomic Selection related analyses and predictions.

## BrAPI
The Breeding API ([BrAPI](https://brapi.org/)) project is an effort to enable interoperability among plant breeding databases. BrAPI is a standardized RESTful web service API specification for communicating plant breeding data. This community driven standard is free to be used by anyone interested in plant breeding data management.

## _Install_
```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("icarda-git/QBMS")
```

>*You can find a set of Breedbase based servers available for several crops and accessible with no authentication required are listed at the BrAPI website on the following page under the group of **Boyce Thompson Institute (BTI)**, discovery and innovation in the life sciences: [https://brapi.org/servers](https://brapi.org/servers).*

## _Example_
```r
# load the QBMS library
library(QBMS)

# Cassava BreedBase server
set_qbms_config("https://cassavabase.org/brapi/v1/calls/", 
                time_out = 300, no_auth = TRUE, engine = "breedbase")

# list supported crops in the current bms server
list_crops()

# select a crop by name
set_crop("Cassava")

# list all breeding programs in the selected crop
list_programs()

# select a breeding program by name
set_program("IITA")

# list all studies/trials in the selected program
list_trials()

# select a specific study/trial by name
set_trial("20_Abuja")

# get observation variable ontology in the selected study/trial
get_trial_obs_ontology()

# list all environments/locations information in the selected study/trial
list_studies()

# select a specific environment/location by name
set_study("20NCRP12yrtAB")

# another option, select a specific study by location name (first match)
# studies <- list_studies()
# set_study(studies[studies$locationName == "Abuja", "studyName"][1])

# retrieve general information, data, and germplasm list 
# of the selected environment/location
info <- get_study_info()
data <- get_study_data()
germplasm <- get_germplasm_list()

# retrieve multi-environment trial data of the selected study/trial
MET <- get_trial_data()

```
## _Troubleshooting the installation_

1. If the installation of QBMS generates errors saying that some of the existing packages cannot be removed, you can try to quit any R session, and try to start R in administrator (Windows) or SUDO mode (Linux/Ubuntu) then try installing again.

2. If you get an error related to packages built under a current version of R, and updating your packages doesn’t help, you can consider overriding the error with the following code. _Note: This might help you install QBMS but may result in other problems. If possible, it’s best to resolve the errors rather than ignoring them._

```r
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = TRUE)

remotes::install_github("icarda-git/QBMS", upgrade = "always")
```
